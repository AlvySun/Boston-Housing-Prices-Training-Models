# Boston-Housing-Prices-Training-Models
A Comparison of Training Effects of Seven Models of Housing Prices in Boston

Boston house prices are a popular data set for solving regression problems in machine learning.
The data, compiled in 1978, included 506 samples of housing prices, each containing 13 characteristic information about houses in different suburbs of Boston,
such as the number of residential rooms, the proportion of teachers and students in urban areas, etc.
The label value is the price of each house (in thousands of dollars); so this is a small data set with 506 by 14 dimensions
